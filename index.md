Assessment 1: My Profile

Cameron Youd

Personal Information
Name: Cameron Youd
Student Number: S3760335
Email address: S3760335@student.rmit.edu.au

I was born at my home in Buderim in QLD, I have grown up my whole life on the sunshine coast and went to school to both Kuluin state school in Kuluin and also St Johns College in Nambour in which I completed grade 12, over the years I have had many pets, but one of my most favourite is the pet I currently own with my partner as it is a nice big Oscar fish called Wesley which will bite your finger off if you put your finger in his water!


Interest in IT

Although my main interest currently is focused on the financial industry, IT does play a large part of how the industry functions, in an expanding and ever growing technological era, knowing how IT affects and promotes not only an individual business but also entire markets is paramount, this is why I have chosen RMIT to study for an IT course, I believe that by the time I finish this course, I will have a much better understanding on how IT can affect my future.

Ideal Job

My ideal job in the future is to become a financial planner in a major city and work my way up through the ranks, as seen in this job application listed below, I will need at least 3 years experience as a Financial planner to even be considered, and to even start my work as a financial planner I will need to finish my Bachelor in Business which makes this my long term goal.

I have had an interest in financial planning ever since my brother introduced me to finance, I have always had a real passion for helping people and I am really good with numbers, a job such as a financial planner is ideal for helping me put both to good use.

An entry level Financial Planner is expected to have at the minimum a Bachelor in Business majoring in Financial Planning, as this is the course I am currently doing, I am expecting to have around another two years before I can participate in my job of choice, I am currently obtaining the skills which will help assist me by working as a CSO in a Financial Planning office which means I get to see the inner workings of Financial Planning and I will be more prepared when I am ready to take the step.

Personal Profile

As I am currently financial unavailable to pay for the official Myers-Briggs test as I could only find it costing $50 online, I have taken a slightly different test, this test is from 16Personalities.com, the results from this test are seen below

The final test I took is a creativity test, the reason I chose this test is that in the financial industry, you need to think of innovative and creative ways of solving problems for clients, I chose the test from testmycreativity.com and the results can be seen below

Your creativity score is 53.55
You (53.55)Typical (63.36)

The results show that I am not very creative compared to the typical person and this will give me something to work towards.

I believe that these test results are quite accurate, I personally know that I am very talkative however my approach to solving problems is to write them down as I have trouble learning verbally and physically, for example, I would much rather be able to watch a lecture and take notes I can reflect on later than listen to a lecture and try to remember, I feel like working in a team environment online, I should have no problem working well within any team, as I am able to look at what is being said and I can take notes easily, however I feel like if I was doing it in person I would have more issues, the ideal team members for me would be people with high creativity levels as they can help me think of ideas I may not have thought of myself.


Project idea – Free mobile app named Easy Invest

I believe that a great project would to be to work on app, this app should have capabilities to show an investor what investments would be a great investment in the share market and also give them an option to purchase the shares directly from their bank account should they decide it is a good option, I feel like in the current era, technology is extremely important, especially when it is at hand, so a mobile application which can give an investor an opportunity to have an edge over another investor could mean a great deal,

This type of app should change the way that stocks and shares will be looked at, a study held by ASX.com.au has shown that in 2012 only 38% of all Australians had any investments directly (via shares or listed investments) or indirectly (using unlisted managed super funds)1 which shows that there is an extremely large market of people who can invest in the Australian and international stocks and shares market, an app like this could simplify and take out the confusion of shares and add more certainty which can attract many more investors.

There is many different ways in which an app of this sort could be made, I believe the most efficient would be to work in co-operation with a website named Morningstar, this website shows an in depth analysis on any different stocks and shares and when used by an investor, can help to produce larger profits, the app should have a direct link to this website and show at demand the profit and loss potential of a certain share or all shares compiled and show what the best ones to invest in in the current time period is.

Another feature that this app will have will be the convenience to purchase from your phone, you will be able to link your payment details and if you find an investment which interests you, the client will have the ability to purchase the investment straight away, this will make the app very handy for people who not only want to invest small amounts here and there but also for large scale investors who are out and about and don’t have time to get on a computer and do their own research and due to this there will be an increased amount of usage from people who would not otherwise use an app for their business

This app should also be able to have a feature called a risk profile, a risk profile is essential for a financial planner to showcase what the clients risk potential is, a risk profile can be set up on the app with a series of questions, these questions will be able to accurately realise if the client wishes for fast short term growth or slow long term growth and point them in the right direction when looking at investments, it will also give notices and warnings should the clients be purchasing something which is considered to be too conservative or risky for their risk profile, I feel like a feature like this will be an amazing way to bring in people who would never normally invest due to investments never being personalized for them.

In an app like this, it would be very important for it to be a free application, as the main target audience for this app is the hesitant investors and an app they have to pay for may scare them away, as it would be highly unethical for an app like this to accept payments from shares and stock managers to promote their products, profit should be made from advertisements, the high client base from an app like this will prove very beneficial to any advertisers so there should be many people investing into the app.

As I have never built an app before, I would go the website Appetiser.com.au for expert help on how to build an app like this, with their services I can hire somebody to help me build an app with all of the capabilities and features I have requested, once the app has been created and uploaded, any person will easily be able to access and use this app.

Should this app be successful, it will change the way Australians look at investing in the stock market, in the short term it won’t have a massive impact, but in the long term, as more people invest in the stock market, it will increase the percentage of Australians who are investing which is indeed a problem in Australia, this will in turn increase the overall amount of money invested in shares in Australia which in the long run will increase a large range of Australian businesses.
